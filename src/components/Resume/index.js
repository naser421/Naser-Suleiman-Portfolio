                          As a certified Full Stack Developer from the UC Berkeley Coding Bootcamp, I am excited to bring my skills and experience into this new field.

                          My passion for healthcare and technology led me to my current position as a Lead Bronchoscopy Technician at UCSF Medical Center, where I have gained valuable experience in managing billing, developing protocols, and training new technicians. Additionally, my experience as a Customer Service Representative at MilkManSF and Emergency Medical Technician at Mobility Express Medical Transport has given me the skills to excel in a customer-facing role, as well as the ability to work effectively under pressure. I am confident in my ability to leverage my technical skills in SQL, Node.js, and data analysis to support your mission of providing client solutions. My proficiency in Epic EMR software and EndoPro by Pentax for billing further enhances my ability to contribute to the team.

                          As a natural problem solver with excellent communication skills, I believe I would be an asset to any team. Please take a look at my resume and thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to further discuss my qualifications and enthusiasm!
